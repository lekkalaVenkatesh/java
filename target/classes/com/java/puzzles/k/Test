Coding & OOD: For coding, they asked maximum subarray question, and for OOD the question was designing an elevator
3) SQL design: They question was about a soccer tournament. We have a number of teams that are playing against each other. They asked me to design data base schema to store the teams, and results of the matches. Then, they asked me to write some queries.
